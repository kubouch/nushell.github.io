# Nushell 0.85
Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.85 of Nu. This release adds...

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it
Nu 0.85 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.85.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features
## Nushell + Uutils = ❤️
📢The Nushell team is thrilled to announce 🥳 that we've begun working with the `uutils/coreutils` team on integrating some of their foundational core utilies into nushell. With this release, we've started with the coreutils `cp` command, which we've temporarily named `ucp`. We're starting with `ucp` to allow broad testing while the current nushell `cp` command remains the default. We've already found one [bug](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/5257) in the coreutils `cp` command and you might find others. Once it stabelizes, probably with the 0.86.0 release, we'll remove the nushell `cp` command and rename `ucp` to `cp`. In keeping with the nushell style, we've only added a handful of parameters. We can, and probably will, add more if the community determines we need them. We're so very excited and would like to thank [terts](https://github.com/tertsdiepraam), from the coreutils team, for his excellent help and special appreciation to [dmatos2012](https://github.com/dmatos2012) for the, very iterative, first `uutils/coreutils` integration PR for the `cp` command. To read more about how this came to be, checkout our blog post [here](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2023-09-05-why-uu.html).

## Consistent use of `float` for our floating point type

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Nushell currently supports two types to represent numbers without units: `int` for integer numbers and `float` for floating point numbers.
The latter type was in important places incorrectly referred to as `decimal`. This hid the fact that as floating point numbers they have limited precision in some circumstances but higher performance compared to a decimal-encoded number.

With this release we fix this inaccuracy.

This means we introduce the commands `into float` and `random float` and deprecate the commands `into decimal` and `random decimal`. The old commands will be removed with the next release but continue to work for this release with a warning.
Please use `into float` instead of `into decimal` and `random float` instead of `random decimal`.

After the type returned by `describe` has been `float` for a while, we now also change which type name is allowed when specifying command argument or input/output types.

```sh
# Argument with a specfic type
def foo [bar: float] {}
# Command taking only floating point input from the pipeline and returning the same type.
def baz [] float->float {}
```
Previously both `float` and `decimal` were supported in those positions.

## Some updates on `explore`

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

The `explore` built-in commands have changed a bit during this release.

Now, it supports Vim bindings out of the box thanks to [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in
[#9966](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9966).
[@rgwood](https://github.com/rgwood) has simplified the available configuration entries which used
to make the command less easy to understand in
[#10258](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10258)
[#10259](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10259) and
[#10270](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10270).

Thanks to him again, one can now quit the `explore`r by hitting any of `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+d` or
`ctrl+q` (see [#10257](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10257)).

## Improvements to parse-time evaluation

_Conditional `source` and `use` is now possible._

The Nushell core team has been asked quite a lot of times to be able to do parse-time conditional
`source`ing or `use`ing in the configuration, e.g. to load different things depending on the system:
```nushell
if $nu.os-info.name == "windows" {
    source "my_windows_config.nu"
} else {
    source "my_unix_config.nu"
}
```

The above snippet does not work because Nushell's scoping rules keep the sourced values inside the if/else block and the sourcing would not have any visible effect outside of the if/else statement (except environment changes).

While scoping still works the same, a series of PRs by [@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch) made conditional `source`/`use`/`overlay use` possible:
- [#9499](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9499), allows parse-time evaluation of commands, pipelines and subexpressions (see also [Looking for help!](#looking-for-help))
- with [#10326](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10326), `if` can now be evaluated at parse time
- finally, [#10160](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10160) makes the `$nu` built-in variable a true constant :partying_face:

What does this all mean? One can now write something very similar to the proposed snippet
above! For example:
```nushell
const WINDOWS_CONFIG = "my_windows_config.nu"
const UNIX_CONFIG = "my_unix_config.nu"

const ACTUAL_CONFIG = if $nu.os-info.name == "windows" {
    $WINDOWS_CONFIG
} else {
    $UNIX_CONFIG
}

source $ACTUAL_CONFIG
```

### Looking for help!

[#9499](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9499) allows running selected commands at parse time. For example, 
```nushell
const f = ($nu.default-config-dir | path dirname)
```
is possible because `path dirname` was manually ported to allow parse time evaluation. Only a very limited subset of Nushell's commands is currently allowed to do so:
* `str length`
* `path` commands
* Some core commands: `describe`, `ignore`, `version`, `if`

We would like to expand this set to allow more commands to run at parse time. If you'd like to help us porting more commands, we'd welcome your help! Please, see [#10239](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10239) for more information. Porting the commands is not difficult, but requires a bit of consideration, so it's better to reply to the issue or reach out to the core team beforehand.

## Improving accessibility
Up until now, an issue for users using a screen reader was that Nushell errors and tables are quite
fancy with some unicode characters.
The issue is that screen reader might have trouble reading them, making the understanding of what's
going on the REPL very hard...

For tables, it's quite easy, you can set `$env.config.table.mode` to something like `"basic"` or
`"none"` and you should be good!
But errors remained fancy
```nushell
Error: nu::shell::external_command

  × External command failed
   ╭─[entry #4:1:1]
 1 │ foo
   · ─┬─
   ·  ╰── did you mean 'for'?
   ╰────
  help: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

[@JoaquinTrinanes](https://github.com/JoaquinTrinanes) did implement screen reader-friendly errors
in [#10122](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10122) which will hopefully make the experience
a lot better when it comes to errors.

## More support for more platforms
In this release, [@dead10ck](https://github.com/dead10ck) made it possible to use Nushell in Termux
([#10013](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10013)) and fixed a bug on Android
([#10225](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10225)).
## Improved history isolation
::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Like many other shells, history between open sessions can be isolated in nushell.
However, the former implementation had the disadvantage that it also blocked access to history of former sessions.
It also didn't isolate hints.
This is now fixed with [!10402](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10402) by [@Hofer-Julian](https://github.com/Hofer-Julian).
Since this was merged shortly before the release, this feature isn't the default yet.
The `file_format` has to be changed to `"sqlite"` and `isolation` has to be set to `true`: https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/39d93b536a02c95c263925a47b9e4c34587ce021/crates/nu-utils/src/sample_config/default_config.nu#L202.
Please test this so we can fix problems before history isolation becomes the default.

## Changes to commands
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!
- a bunch of new columns have been added to the `ps` commands:
    - [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#10275](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10275)
        and [#10344](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10344)
    - [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in
        [#10347](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10347)
- [@nanoqsh](https://github.com/nanoqsh) has made the behaviour of `append` and `prepend` consistent
    regarding ranges in [#10231](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10231)
- [@Tiggax](https://github.com/Tiggax) has started working on making `select`, `get` and `reject`
    more consistent in [#10163](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10163) and
    [#10216](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10216)
- (!breaking change!) math constants have been moved from built-in commands to *true* constants in
    the standard library by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in
    [#9678](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9678)
- the `into duration` command now accepts integers as arguments and the unit can be specified via an
    option with the changes introduced by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in
    [#10286](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10286)
- thanks to [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in
    [#10354](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10354), the `commandline` command can now move
    you to the end of the line, no need to "move 1000 characters to the right" anymore

## Some table themes
Want more delight? [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) got you covered.
He added a bunch of new table themes / modes in
[#10279](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10279).

## `echo` is evolving
Coming from other shells, e.g. POSIX ones like Bash or Zsh, the distinction between Nushell's `echo`
and `print` commands and the behaviour of `echo` itself could be confusing :thinking:

- `print` is a more programming-language-friendly command: it does print its arguments to the
    terminal directly, consuming them and thus not allowing to pipe the "output" of print further.
- `echo` was only used to create values and pass them down a pipeline, e.g. `echo "foo" | str length`

[@jntrnr](https://github.com/jntrnr) made the behaviour of `echo` a bit more general
- it will print to the terminal if not redirected
- it will pass the value down to the pipeline if redirected

```nushell
echo "foo"  # will behave exactly as `print` does
echo "foo" | str length  # will compute the length of `"foo"` and forward the result without
                         # "printing" it unless it's the last command being run
```

## Pythonesque operators removal

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Coming from Python, things like
```python
3 * "foo"
[1, 2] * 10
```
would probably appear familiar.

However, they could lead to some strange internal behaviours and hard to debug issues :confused:
```nushell
> [3, "bob", 4] | reduce --fold 1 {|x, y| $x * $y}
bobbobbobbobbobbobbobbobbobbobbobbob
```

> **Note**
> in the example above, we are mixing integer and string multiplication, which might get weird!

In this release, we decided to remove the string and list scalar multiplication in
[#10292](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10292) and
[#10293](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10293) from [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach).

However, we do not want to leave you without any other way to achieve the same, this is why
[@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) did implement the `repeat` command in the standard library
in [#10339](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10339)
- bring it into your scope with `use std repeat`
- you can do scalar string multiplication with something like `"foo" | repeat 3 | str join`
- you can do scalar list multiplication with something like `[1, 2] | repeat 3 | flatten`

## Optimizations
[#10378](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10378) Switched the default allocator to `mimalloc` as it's shown to reduce startup time by upwards of 30% on Windows. If it does not build on unique platforms nushell can be built without this feature, then using the platform's default allocator.

# New commands
- [`into float`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9979) as a replacement for `into decimal`
- [`random float`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10320) as a replacement for `random decimal`

In the standard library we added the following commands:
- [`std repeat`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10339) as a command to repeat an element `n` times in a list.
- [`std formats from ndjson`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10283) as a way to directly open newline-delimited JSON recrods. You can use `open` for files with the `.ndjson` ending if you `use std formats "from ndjson"`.
- [`std formats from jsonl`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10283) as a way to directly open newline-delimited JSON records. You can use `open` for files with the `.jsonl` ending if you `use std formats "from jsonl"`.

# Deprecations
## Deprecated commands
- [`into decimal`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9979): Use `into float` instead
- [`random decimal`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10320): Use `random float` instead

# Breaking changes
